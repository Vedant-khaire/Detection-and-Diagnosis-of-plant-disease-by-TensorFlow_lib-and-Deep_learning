# Detection-and-Diagnosis-of-plant-disease-by-Digital-image-processing
This project aims to develop an automated system for the
detection and diagnosis of diseases in plants and crops using Digital
Image Processing (DIP). The system will leverage image capture
technology to acquire images of plants, apply advanced image
processing techniques to identify potential diseases or fungi, and
provide solutions for effective plant health management.
